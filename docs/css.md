# Fundamental concepts
There is very little fundamental knowledge you need.

## Never let margin bleed
You really only need to know the difference between `margin` (something that's outside) and `padding` (something that is inside). Here's a picture:

One more thing about margin : *it collapses*. This means that if two items are next to each other with a margin of `30px` and `20px`, instead of of being separated by `50px` they will be separated by `30px`. This shown below:

Not only that, if an element is unfortunate to be at the border of its parent, its margin will collapse with its parent. These facts are shown below:

This makes it very difficult to create a maintainable layout system if your components have external margins

* Don't have an external `margin` on components.
* `margin` is something that a parent should push down to put a visual seperation between its children. More on this later.

## Avoid inline
Having an element as `display: inline` means that it completely ignores its height. Here is a visual difference where an element has been given a height but `inline` ignored it and `inline-block` got it.

Also you cannot CSS3 transform inline elements. So use a `span` but if there is anything fancy you need the `span` to do, be sure to `inline-block` it.

# Basic Setup
There are very few simple things about the default layout of an HTML page that need to be setup in order to prepare it for the application development era:

* Full Sized Body
* Box Model

## Full Sized Body
You really want the root of your page to be something that takes up all the available space on screen and provides it as a drawing canvas for children. This can be done easily:

```css
html, body {
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    padding: 0px;
    margin: 0px;
}
```

## Box Model
You really want the `width`/`height` of an element to represent the `border+padding+content`. This is shown below:

It sounds something basic but the first HTML spec got wrong. Its easy to fix though:

```css
html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
*, *:before, *:after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}
```

# Root
Finally with modern web frameworks you normally render to some container div. e.g. `root` in the following example:

```html
<html>
<body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="./build/bundle.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

You probably want `#root` to be the same size as the body. Easily done by making its width / height `100%`.

# `setupPage`
Combine all that we've talked about and we have the following page setup.

```html
<html>
<body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="./build/bundle.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

```ts
import {setupPage} from "typestyle/csx";
setupPage('#root');
```

* sets up box model
* sets up `html/body` size
* sets up root component size

Easy as :)

# `normalize`
Browsers have different default styles for a few a the native tags e.g. the `template` tag *does not have `display: none` in IE but has it in all other browers. The list of such quirks is small but not something that you should bother with. This is why [normalize.css] exists. It is used by all the popular css frameworks including bootstrap. So a good idea to include in your own designs as well. Super simple with `csx/normalize` ;)

```ts
import {normalize} from "typestyle/csx";
normalize();

// Yay. Browser quirks ironed out
```

# Recommended page setup

Hence the recommended page setup

```html
<html>
<body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="./build/bundle.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

```ts
import {normalize, setupPage} from "typestyle/csx";

normalize();
setupPage('#root');

// All your designs will now be more consistent across browsers
```
